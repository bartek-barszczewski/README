## About me:
I have been working as a Full Stack Developer for 2 years, creating software from scratch to support warehouse processesâ€”and having a great time doing it! Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Have any questions? Feel free to reach out!

Although I have been programming commercially for only two years, programming has been my passion for a long time.  
I love exploring various technologies, and my main goal for the future is to work in the field of cybersecurity.

## My experience:
**Automation** - Using Python, I write automation scripts that process data and deliver results.

**RemoteSupport** - A web application for scanners that supports work at a position where a person performs the role of a Supporter. The application allows ordering packages for specific workstations and monitoring the progress of these orders.

**ECS** - An evacuation control system that enables the registration of employees at evacuation points and monitors the evacuation process.

**DVM-D** - An application that displays real-time tabular audit data and the process results of various warehouse departments.

**Calendars** - A web application that combines various HR functions, such as tracking employee attendance and monitoring absences.

**Cybersecurity** - Based on reports provided by Checkmarx software and security standards like OWASP Top Ten, I secured the aforementioned applications to minimize risks by implementing secure coding practices, mitigating vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, insecure configurations, and other critical risks. Additionally, I conducted code reviews and implemented security checks to ensure consistent compliance with security standards.
Furthermore, my responsibilities include reacting to penetration testing reports provided by external companies by implementing the necessary security measures to safeguard the applications.
